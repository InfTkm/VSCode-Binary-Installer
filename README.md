# VSCode-Binary-Installer (For UofT Teaching Lab Machine)
This script can download the binary version of the VSCode and create a launcher on the desktop. I have hosted the script file on my subdomain.

# Usage
Run `curl -s https://meng.compsci.dev/vsinstaller.sh | bash` on the teaching lab machine.

# Why use
VSCode is quite popular. There were juniour students who ask me how to install it on the lab machine since we don't have root privileges.
So I wrote this to automate the process.
